Thanks for wanting to use Vagrant! Unfortunately, this is not the way
to install Vagrant anymore. We now make installers for the various operating
systems Vagrant supports.

Vagrant is no longer distributed as a RubyGem. Please download the latest
version for your operating system from the URL below. If you still wish
to use the RubyGem version, you can manually install version 1.0.7. Note that
the RubyGem version hasn't been updated in over a year and will no longer
receive any updates.

Prior to installing Vagrant using the installer, make sure you uninstall
all your Vagrant gems, since they sometimes conflict.
